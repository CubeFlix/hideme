a tool for hiding large amounts of data on your computer using AES encryption

## NOTE:

## How it Works
`hideme` works by first encrypting your data using secure 32-bit AES encryption. Next, it randomly chooses a number of locations camoflauged as system files to hide the data in. Using `hideme`, you can easily encrypt and decrypt your secure, personal data using a password known only to you.
